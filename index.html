      <p>Welcome to New Charleston! Today, we’re going to go on an  underwater excursion to the original Charleston. Fun Fact: Before this coastline was here, this was a sleepy little suburb called Summerville.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='pg_2'>
      <p>People used to come here for this city’s cultural and charm before the sea level rose so much that it got submerged.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='pg_3'>
      <p>To learn more about what this place used to be like, we’ll have to go underwater.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='pg_4'>
      <p>People used to love visiting Rainbow Row. I promise the colors were vibrant without the water.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='pg_5'>
      <p>People also used to visit the Angel Oak Trees. They’re gradually disintigrating underground, but above ground they had leaves and moss.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='pg_6'>
      <p>Next we’ll go down to Old Savannah.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='pg_7'>
      <p>Similar to Old Charleston, people liked the... previously vibrant architecture.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='pg_8'>
      <p>Some people still come to Old Savannah’s historic houses of worship for raft services.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='pg_9'>
      <p>Welcome back to New Charleston! Old Savannah and Old Charleston drowned because of glaciers melting due to climate change. If we don't curb our greenhouse gas emissions, one day the same thing will happen to New Charleston.</p>
